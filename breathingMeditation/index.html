                I built this small application as a way to help me focus during
                this unsettling time of the COVID-19 pandemic. I was feeling
                overwhelmed with everything going on in the world, and having
                trouble concentrating on react and vue and algorithms and
                accessibility, performance, build tools, package managers,
                testing frameworks, and the gazillion other things necessary to
                learn in order to become a front-end developer in 2020. So I
                decided to build something to help people intentionally focus on
                their breath. The idea is that when you are focused on your
                breath, you are slowing down and becoming grounded in the
                present moment.

                Inhale as the flower expands. Exhale as it contracts. Just...
                breathe.
